# Create, Train, and Publish your Knowledge Base
You can create a QnA Maker knowledge base (KB) from your own content, such as FAQs or product manuals. The QnA Maker KB in this example is created from a simple FAQ webpage to answer questions on BitLocker key recovery.

### Prerequisite
If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Create a QnA Maker knowledge base
1. Sign in to **QnAMaker.ai** with your Azure credentials.

2. On the QnA Maker website, select **Create a knowledge base**.

3. On the **Create page**, in step 1, select ```Create a QnA service```. You are directed to the Azure portal to set up a QnA Maker service in your subscription. If the Azure portal times out, select Try again on the site. After you connect, your Azure dashboard appears.

4. After you successfully create a new QnA Maker service in Azure, return to qnamaker.ai/create. Select your QnA service from the drop-down lists in step 2. If you created a new QnA service, be sure to refresh the page.
