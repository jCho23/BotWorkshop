# Create a QnA Bot with Azure Bot Service
This tutorial walks you through building a QnA bot with Azure Bot service on the Azure portal.

## Prerequisite
Before you build, follow the steps in **Create and publish a knowledge base** to create a QnA Maker service with questions and answers.

The bot responds to questions from the knowledge base you created, via the QnAMakerDialog.

## Create a QnA Bot
1. In the Azure portal, select ```Create new resource``` in the menu blade, and then select ```See all```.
