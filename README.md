# What is QnA Maker?
QnA Maker enables you to power a question and answer service from your semi-structured content like FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) documents or URLs and product manuals. You can build a model of questions and answers that is flexible to user queries, providing responses that you'll train a bot to use in a natural, conversational way.

An easy-to-use graphical user interface enables you to create, manage, train and get your service up and running without any developer experience.
