# BotWorkshop
This workshop is designed for developers to Build, Train and Publish a simple question and answer bot based on FAQ URLs, structured documents, product manuals or editorial content.

# What is QnA Maker?
QnA Maker enables you to power a question and answer service from your semi-structured content like FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) documents or URLs and product manuals. You can build a model of questions and answers that is flexible to user queries, providing responses that you'll train a bot to use in a natural, conversational way.

An easy-to-use graphical user interface enables you to create, manage, train and get your service up and running without any developer experience.

## Highlights
* A complete no-code experience to create a FAQ bot.
* No more network throttling. Pay for hosting the service and not for the number of transactions. 
* Scale as per your needs. Choose the appropriate SKUs of the individual components that suit your scenario. 
* Full data compliance. The data and runtime components are deployed in the user's Azure subscription and within their compliance boundary. Read below for more details.

# Key QnA Maker processes
A QnA Maker provides two key services for your data:
* **Extraction:** Structured question-answer data is extracted from semi-structured data sources like FAQs and product manuals. This extraction is done when creating the knowledge base.
* **Matching:** Once your knowledge base has been trained and tested, you publish it. This enables an endpoint to your QnA Maker knowledge base, which you can then use in your bot or app. This endpoint accepts a user question and responds with the best question/answer match in the knowledge base, along with a confidence score for the match.
