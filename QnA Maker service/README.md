# Create a QnA Maker Service

Before you can create any QnA Maker knowledge bases, you must first set up a QnA Maker service in Azure. Anyone with authorization to create new resources in a subscription can set up a QnA Maker service.

This setup deploys a few Azure resources. Together, these resources manage the knowledge base content and provide question-answering capabilities though an endpoint.

1. Log in to the [Azure portal](portal.azure.com).

2. Click on **Add New Resource**, and type ```"qna maker"``` in search, and select the QnA Maker resource.
